# LSTM-Network-to-Recognize-Mean-Reversions-Against-Boosted-Feedforward-Abstract
There has been much development on the usage of supervised learning to forecast financial time series by using various feature combinations of lagged price and technicals. Most prominently, research has applied high-dimensional support vector classifiers and feedforward neural networks trained with genetic algorithms or gradient descent. However, by using near-sighted algorithms, the available literature fails to capture the full memory retention of equities and indicators. 

Furthermore, this experiment differs from prior studies in that it (a) specifically targets the z-scores of momentum indicators in order to anticipate mean reversions and (b) uses a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to capture the full memory span of financial time series. Additionally, we minimize model exposure to external factors by trading equities with minimal volatility and low correlation to sector ETFs. 

We evaluate the LSTM algorithm against a feedforward network where time lags are manually selected for input and train via logistic boosting, which learns to identify complementary signals across indicators. In both cases, the output is classified into either a buy, hold, or sell signal and positions are respectively acquired. The strategies are backtested using the Quantopian platform.
