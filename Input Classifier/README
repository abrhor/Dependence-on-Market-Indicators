# Summary

RSI Classification attempt: The majority of this data falls between 30-80 (non-extreme values). 80 is up there, but there is no real significance signal unless it moves to about 87-90 on the upside and about 20 on the downside, corroborating the distribution results. Very few reliable trades available according to this.
